# Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a randomly generated password based on a user's criteria. Using JavaScript, I created a series of prompts to ask the user their desired length and which characters they would like included. Based on those choices, the program then selects which arrays of characters to include in the password. Using Math.floor() and Math.random() inside a for loop, it selects a random character from the chosen arrays and adds it to the new password until it reaches the desired length.
